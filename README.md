# AOC22

You can run all the challenges so far by running `python alldays.py` (To Jack - hopefully this makes checking the answers a bit easier/faster :) )

Each python script will print out the answer for the first and second part of each advent of code 2022 challenge. To change the input, simply change the contents of the corresponding input file.
