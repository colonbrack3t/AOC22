# AOC22

You can run all the challenges so far by running `python alldays.py`

Each python script will print out the answer for the first and second part of each advent of code 2022 challenge. To change the input, simply change the corresponding input file. In some cases (e.g. day 5) you may have to change some constants in the python files themselves.
